# RichEdit for ASP.NET Core - How to integrate the control into a Blazor client application

 This example illustrates how to integrate the client part of ASP.NET Core [RichEdit](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/400373/office-inspired-controls/controls/rich-edit) into a Blazor client application.

> **NOTE** 
Starting with v22.2, the [DevExpress Blazor product line](xref:400725) includes the [Rich Text Editor](xref:DevExpress.Blazor.RichEdit.DxRichEdit) UI component that you can use in Blazor client applications.

## Requirements
- To use the RichEdit control in a Blazor application, you need to have a [Universal, DXperience, or ASP.NET subscription](https://www.devexpress.com/buy/net/).
- Versions of devexpress npm packages should be identical (their major and minor versions should be the same).
